# Foundations of Probability

Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur,
ranging from 0 to 1.

A random experiment is a process with an uncertain outcome.

The set of all possible outcomes is called the **Sample Space (S)**.

An **Event (E)** is a subset of the sample space.
